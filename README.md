swift cheat sheet for quick reference

Intention:
- To have importance frequently used the swift functions for problem solving and algorithms.
- Have some common algorithms for quick reference in each category.
- Reference for data structure implementation
- May be more than 1 solution listed for some of them.

  Note:
  Algorithms given may not have the desired level of conciseness & optimization. Goal is to make it easy to understand.
